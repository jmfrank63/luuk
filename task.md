# LUUK Assignment

Hello!

Thank you for responding to the vacancy of Backend Developer in the beauty platform LUUK. We select candidates in several stages: solving a test assignment, a technical interview and an interview with the company's management.

In order to proceed to the technical interview, we ask you to write a small JavaScript service, accessible through your own API, which outputs data on the daily temperature in Moscow at about 14:00 for as many days as possible. To get a weather report, you will need to use the Weather Service API yr.no We would like to receive the solution by e-mail to <job@reshenia.group> as a link to the Git repository with a Docker file from which you can instantly deploy the service.

Additional points are awarded if:

- The service in general and the API in particular have meaningful and useful documentation
- The code is equipped with a set of automatic tests that are not a mere formality
- In addition to Moscow, you can specify another location by coordinates
- The locality can be found by name
- Overload protection is provided yr.no requests through this service
- A Web interface is available that allows you to work with the service not only through the API, but also through the browser, like a regular user
- The service has other improvements at the discretion of the author

I will be glad to answer your questions sent to <job@resheniya.group>
Good luck, and I hope to see you at the technical interview soon.
